# GitHub Actions Integration - Automatic README Statistics

## ✅ What's Been Integrated

Your GitHub Actions workflow now **automatically updates** all the comprehensive statistics in your README whenever the CISA KEV data changes!

## 🔄 How It Works

### Workflow Steps:

1. **Download KEV Data** (existing)
   - Fetches latest CISA KEV CSV
   - Updates `cisa-kev.csv`

2. **Match Nuclei Templates** (existing)
   - Clones nuclei-templates repo
   - Generates `NucleiList.txt`
   - Creates `CISA-Scannable-List.txt`

3. **Set Up Python** (NEW!)
   - Installs Python 3.9
   - Installs required packages (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy)

4. **Generate Statistics** (NEW!)
   - Runs `scripts/generate_stats.py`
   - Analyzes entire KEV database
   - Creates comprehensive statistics
   - Includes vendor tables, product tables, CWE analysis, etc.

5. **Update README** (NEW!)
   - Extracts old statistics section
   - Inserts newly generated statistics
   - Updates all tables and metrics
   - Preserves rest of README content

6. **Commit & Push** (existing)
   - Commits all changes
   - Pushes to repository

7. **Slack Notification** (existing)
   - Sends alert if new CVEs added

## 📊 What Gets Auto-Updated in README

Every time the workflow runs, these statistics update automatically:

### Overview Stats:
- Total CVEs in KEV
- Scannable with Nuclei (count & percentage)
- Unscannable (count & percentage)
- Ransomware-Associated (count & percentage)
- Unique Vendors
- Unique Products

### Recent Activity:
- CVEs Added (last 30 days)
- Scannable Added (last 30 days)
- New Coverage percentage

### Comprehensive Tables:
- ✅ Top 10 Affected Vendors (with coverage %)
- ✅ Top 10 Vulnerable Products
- ✅ Top 5 Vulnerability Types (CWEs)
- ✅ Ransomware-Associated CVEs by Vendor

### Key Insights:
- Most represented vendor
- Total scannable CVEs
- Ransomware statistics
- Recent additions
- Most common CWE type
- Coverage highlights

### Timestamp:
- "Statistics last updated: YYYY-MM-DD"

## 🕐 Update Schedule

The statistics automatically update:
- **6 AM UTC** - Monday through Friday
- **3 PM UTC** - Monday through Friday
- **On-demand** - Via workflow dispatch

## 🎯 Benefits

### Before Integration:
- ❌ Manual stats updates required
- ❌ Stats could become stale
- ❌ Time-consuming to maintain
- ❌ Risk of human error

### After Integration:
- ✅ Fully automatic updates
- ✅ Always current data
- ✅ Zero manual maintenance
- ✅ Consistent formatting
- ✅ Professional presentation

## 📝 Technical Details

### Modified File:
`.github/workflows/CISA.yaml`

### New Steps Added:
```yaml
- name: Set up Python
  uses: actions/setup-python@v4
  with:
    python-version: '3.9'

- name: Install Python dependencies
  run: |
    python -m pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy

- name: Generate comprehensive statistics
  run: |
    python scripts/generate_stats.py > /tmp/new_stats.md

- name: Update README with new statistics
  run: |
    # Extract everything before stats
    sed -n '1,/## 📊 Database Statistics/p' README.md | head -n -1 > /tmp/readme_before.md
    
    # Extract everything after stats
    sed -n '/^\*Statistics last updated:/,$ p' README.md | tail -n +2 > /tmp/readme_after.md
    
    # Combine: before + new stats + after
    cat /tmp/readme_before.md > README.md
    cat /tmp/new_stats.md >> README.md
    echo "" >> README.md
    echo "---" >> README.md
    cat /tmp/readme_after.md >> README.md
```

### How It Updates README:
1. Splits README into three parts:
   - Before statistics section
   - Statistics section (to be replaced)
   - After statistics section
2. Generates fresh statistics with `generate_stats.py`
3. Reconstructs README with new statistics
4. Commits the updated README

## 🔍 What You'll See

When the workflow runs successfully:

1. **Commit message**: "CISA KEV Updates"
2. **Updated files**:
   - `cisa-kev.csv`
   - `NucleiList.txt`
   - `CISA-Scannable-List.txt`
   - `README.md` ⭐ (with fresh statistics!)

3. **Slack notification** (if new CVEs):
   - New vulnerabilities count
   - Total vulnerabilities
   - Scannable list count

## 🧪 Testing

To test the integration:

```bash
# Option 1: Wait for scheduled run (6 AM or 3 PM UTC on weekdays)

# Option 2: Trigger manually
# 1. Go to Actions tab on GitHub
# 2. Select "CISA KEV" workflow
# 3. Click "Run workflow"
# 4. Select branch (main)
# 5. Click "Run workflow"

# Option 3: Make a commit to trigger (if configured)
```

After the workflow runs, check:
1. Actions tab for successful completion
2. README.md for updated statistics
3. Commit history for "CISA KEV Updates"

## 📋 Monitoring

### Check Workflow Status:
- Go to your repo → Actions tab
- Click on latest "CISA KEV" workflow run
- Review each step for success/failure

### Common Issues:
- **Python packages fail**: Check requirements in workflow
- **Stats not updating**: Check `generate_stats.py` runs successfully
- **README format broken**: Check sed commands in workflow

### Logs to Check:
- "Generate comprehensive statistics" step
- "Update README with new statistics" step
- "Commit changes" step
