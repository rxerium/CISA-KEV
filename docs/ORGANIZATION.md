# 📁 Repository Organization & Month-on-Month Analysis

## ✅ What's Been Done

### 1. 🗂️ Better File Organization

Your repository is now organized into a clean, professional structure:

```
CISA-KEV-Scanning-Capabilities/
│
├── 📊 Data Files (Root Level)
│   ├── cisa-kev.csv              # Main KEV database
│   ├── NucleiList.txt            # Available Nuclei templates
│   └── CISA-Scannable-List.txt   # Scannable CVEs

```

### 2. 📊 Month-on-Month Analysis (NEW!)

The `visualize_trends.py` script now includes a **4th panel** showing month-on-month changes!

#### What It Shows:
- **Bar chart** comparing:
  - Total CVEs added (red bars)
  - Scannable CVEs added (green bars)
- **Value labels** on each bar showing the exact increase
- **Zero baseline** for easy visualization
- **Period-by-period comparison** to see growth patterns

#### Enhanced Statistics:
The console output now includes:
```
📊 Month-on-Month Statistics:
  Average monthly increase (Total): 12.5 CVEs
  Average monthly increase (Scannable): 3.2 CVEs
  Largest monthly increase (Total): 45 CVEs on 2025-03-15
  Largest monthly increase (Scannable): 8 CVEs on 2025-03-15
```

### 3. 🎯 Output Management

All generated files now go to organized locations:
- **Graphs**: `outputs/graphs/*.png`
- **Data**: `outputs/data/` (for future exports)
- Clean separation from source code
- `.gitignore` configured to exclude generated files

### 4. 🚀 Updated Commands

All commands now work with the new structure:

```bash
# Quick access with Make
make trends        # Creates 4-panel graph with M-o-M analysis
make analytics     # Generates all analytics in outputs/graphs/
make stats         # Show statistics
make show-outputs  # List all generated files

# Or use Python directly
python scripts/visualize_trends.py
python scripts/kev_analytics.py
python scripts/kev_query.py --stats
```

## 📊 The New Month-on-Month Panel

### What You'll See:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

│      Green bars = Scannable CVEs added              │
│                                                      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Key Features:
✅ Visual comparison of growth rates  
✅ Easily spot acceleration or deceleration  
✅ Identify periods of high activity  
✅ Track scanning capability improvements  
✅ Professional presentation-ready format  

## 🔍 How It Works

The script:
1. Reads your git history
2. Extracts stats from each commit
3. Calculates differences between consecutive points
4. Creates visual bar chart showing changes
5. Adds helpful labels and statistics

## 📈 Example Output

When you run `make trends`, you'll get:

```

## 🎨 The Complete Visualization

Your `kev_trends.png` now has **4 panels**:

1. **Top Panel**: Total CVEs vs Scannable CVEs (line graph)
2. **Second Panel**: Coverage Percentage (line graph)
3. **Third Panel**: Gap Analysis (area chart)
4. **Bottom Panel**: Month-on-Month Changes (bar chart) 🆕

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Changes to visualize_trends.py:
- Added `calculate_month_on_month()` function
- Enhanced `plot_trends()` with 4th subplot
- Updated `generate_summary_stats()` with M-o-M metrics
- Changed output path to `outputs/graphs/`

### Changes to kev_analytics.py:
- All 6 visualizations now save to `outputs/graphs/`
- Added Path import for directory creation
- Auto-creates output directories if needed

### Changes to Project Structure:
- Created `scripts/`, `docs/`, `outputs/` folders
- Moved Python scripts to `scripts/`
- Moved docs to `docs/`
- Added `.gitignore` for output files
- Added `.gitkeep` files to preserve directory structure

## 🚦 Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Everything is already set up if you ran setup before
# 2. Generate the new 4-panel graph with M-o-M analysis
make trends

# 3. View all outputs
ls -lh outputs/graphs/

# 4. Generate all analytics
make all
```

## 📊 Output Files Location

All generated visualizations are now in `outputs/graphs/`:
- `kev_trends.png` - 4-panel trend analysis (with M-o-M!)
- `vendor_analysis.png` - Top vendors chart
- `product_analysis.png` - Top products chart
- `temporal_trends.png` - Monthly/cumulative trends
- `ransomware_analysis.png` - Ransomware CVE analysis
- `cwe_distribution.png` - CWE types distribution
- `vendor_coverage.png` - Coverage by vendor

## 💡 Benefits of New Organization

### Before:
```
❌ Scripts mixed with data files
❌ Generated PNGs in root directory
❌ Documentation scattered
❌ Hard to find specific files
```

### After:
```
✅ Clean separation of concerns
✅ Easy to find and manage outputs
✅ Professional structure
✅ Git-friendly (.gitignore configured)
✅ Scalable for future additions
```

## 🎯 What This Solves

1. **Month-on-Month Analysis**: You can now see exactly how much the KEV grows each period
2. **Better Organization**: Professional folder structure makes the repo easier to navigate
3. **Clean Outputs**: All visualizations in one place
4. **Maintainability**: Easy to add new scripts or outputs
5. **Professionalism**: Structure matches industry standards

## 🚀 Next Steps

You can now:
1. Run `make trends` to see the new M-o-M analysis
2. Share the clean, organized repo structure
3. Add more scripts to `scripts/` folder
4. Add more docs to `docs/` folder
5. Export data to `outputs/data/` in future enhancements

**Everything is ready to use!** Just run `make trends` to see your new 4-panel graph with month-on-month changes! 🎉
