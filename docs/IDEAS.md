## 💡 Quick Wins (Easy to Implement)

1. **Search by CWE**: Add `--cwe` flag to query tool
2. **JSON export**: Add `--json` output format
3. **Color coding**: Terminal colors for better readability
4. **Progress bars**: Show progress for long operations
5. **Recent changes**: Track and highlight changes between runs
6. **CVE age**: Calculate days since added
7. **Due date alerts**: Flag overdue CVEs
8. **Bulk lookup**: Accept multiple CVE IDs
9. **Watchlist**: Track specific CVEs/vendors
10. **Diff reports**: Show what changed between two dates
